# Inference of Boolean Networks for the Intra-erythrocytic Cycle of the Malaria Parasite

This repository contains the code developed for the final undergraduate project in Pharmacy-Biochemistry at the University of SÃ£o Paulo's Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The project focuses on constructing and simulating Boolean networks to represent biological interactions of Plasmodium falciparum during its intra-erythrocytic cycle, aiming to identify critical nodes as potential therapeutic targets.

The code leverages Python and libraries such as numpy, pandas, and graphviz, among others, for computational modeling and network visualization. This repository includes scripts and notebooks to enable reproduction and further exploration of the experiments described in the study.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
